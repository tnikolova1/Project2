      <p class="Text1">Bulgaria officially the Republic of Bulgaria (Bulgarian: Република България, tr. Republika Bǎlgariya) is a country in Southeast Europe. </p>
      <p class="Text1">It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and North Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. </p>
      <p class="Text1">The capital and largest city is Sofia; other major cities are Plovdiv, Varna and Burgas. With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855 sq mi), Bulgaria is Europe's 16th-largest country. </p>
      <p class="Text1">Bulgaria is a Balkan nation with diverse terrain encompassing Black Sea coastline, a mountainous interior and rivers, including the Danube. A cultural melting pot with Greek, Slavic, Ottoman, </p>
      <p class="Text1">and Persian influences, it has a rich heritage of traditional dance, music, costumes, and crafts. </p>
      <p class="Text1">At the foot of domed Vitosha mountain is its capital city, Sofia, dating to the 5th century B.C.</p>
    <h2 class="History">Brief History</h2>
      <p class="Text2">Emerging from centuries of Ottoman rule, Bulgaria gained its independence in the late 19th century, </p>
      <p class="Text2">joined the losing side of several conflagrations in the first half of the 20th century, and, despite gravitating toward </p>
      <p class="Text2">the Axis powers in World War II, found itself within close orbit of the Soviet Union by mid-century. This alliance had profound effects on </p>
      <p class="Text2">the Bulgarian state and psyche, altering everything from land use and labour practices to religion and the arts. As communist governments fell in eastern</p>
      <p class="Text2">Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Bulgaria was suddenly released from the magnetic field of the Soviet giant and drifted into the uneasy terrain of postcommunism.</p>
    <h2 class="Union">European Union</h2>
      <p class="Text3">Bulgaria is a member of the European Union, NATO, and the Council of Europe; it is a founding state of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and has</p>
      <p class="Text3">taken a seat on the UN Security Council three times. Its market economy is part of the European Single Market and mostly relies on services, followed by industry—especially machine</p>
      <p class="Text3">building and mining—and agriculture. Widespread corruption is a major socioeconomic issue; it ranked as the most corrupt country in the European Union for 2018.</p>
    <h2 class="Language">Language</h2>
      <p class="Text4">The Bulgarian language belongs to the South Slavic group, along with Serbo-Croatian and Slovene; closely related to Bulgarian is Macedonian. A number of dialects remain in common speech.</p>
      <p class="Text4"> Bulgarian is written in the Cyrillic alphabet.</p>

      <p class="Text5">Most of Bulgaria has a moderate continental climate, which is tempered by Mediterranean influences in the south. The average annual temperature is 51 °F (10.5 °C), but this conceals a wide</p>
      <p class="Text5">variation; temperatures as low as −37 °F (−38 °C) and as high as 113 °F (45 °C) have been recorded. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 18 inches (450 mm) in the northeast to more than</p>
      <p class="Text2">47 inches (1,190 mm) in the highest mountains. The lowlands receive snowfall from mid-October to mid-May, with an annual average of 25–30 days of snow cover. Hailstorms occur between May and August.</p>

      <p class="Text6">Tourism in Bulgaria has grown markedly since the 1960s. Roughly 750,000 annual foreign arrivals were arriving in Bulgaria in 2005. In addition to the popular Black Sea resorts, tourists visit </p>
      <p class="Text6">historical centres such as Sofia, Plovdiv, and Rila Monastery and winter sports centres such as Borovets in the Rhodope Mountains. Pirin National Park, which occupies 67,700 acres (27,400 hectares)</p>
      <p class="Text6">in the Pirin Mountains, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983; the World Heritage site was expanded in 2010 to cover an additional 25,000 acres (10,000 hectares).</p>
