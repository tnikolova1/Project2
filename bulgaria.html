    <h2>European country</h2>
      <img src="Images/bg3.jpg" alt="map">
      <img src="Images/Bg1.jpg" alt="Bulgaria">
      <p>Bulgaria officially the Republic of Bulgaria (Bulgarian: Република България, tr. Republika Bǎlgariya) is a country in Southeast Europe. </p>
      <p>It is bordered by Romania to the north, Serbia and North Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. </p>
      <p>The capital and largest city is Sofia; other major cities are Plovdiv, Varna and Burgas. With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855 sq mi), Bulgaria is Europe's 16th-largest country. </p>
      <p>Bulgaria is a Balkan nation with diverse terrain encompassing Black Sea coastline, a mountainous interior and rivers, including the Danube. A cultural melting pot with Greek, Slavic, Ottoman, </p>
      <p>and Persian influences, it has a rich heritage of traditional dance, music, costumes, and crafts. </p>
      <p>At the foot of domed Vitosha mountain is its capital city, Sofia, dating to the 5th century B.C.</p>
    <h2>Brief History</h2>
      <p>Emerging from centuries of Ottoman rule, Bulgaria gained its independence in the late 19th century, </p>
      <p>joined the losing side of several conflagrations in the first half of the 20th century, and, despite gravitating toward </p>
      <p>the Axis powers in World War II, found itself within close orbit of the Soviet Union by mid-century. This alliance had profound effects on </p>
      <p>the Bulgarian state and psyche, altering everything from land use and labour practices to religion and the arts. As communist governments fell in eastern</p>
      <p>Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Bulgaria was suddenly released from the magnetic field of the Soviet giant and drifted into the uneasy terrain of postcommunism.</p>
    <h2>European Union</h2>
      <p>Bulgaria is a member of the European Union, NATO, and the Council of Europe; it is a founding state of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and has</p>
      <p>taken a seat on the UN Security Council three times. Its market economy is part of the European Single Market and mostly relies on services, followed by industry—especially machine</p>
      <p>building and mining—and agriculture. Widespread corruption is a major socioeconomic issue; it ranked as the most corrupt country in the European Union for 2018.</p>
    <h2>Language</h2>
      <p>The Bulgarian language belongs to the South Slavic group, along with Serbo-Croatian and Slovene; closely related to Bulgarian is Macedonian. A number of dialects remain in common speech.</p>
      <p> Bulgarian is written in the Cyrillic alphabet.</p>
    <h2>Climate</h2>

      <img src="Images/Bg5.jpg" alt="sea" >
      <p>Most of Bulgaria has a moderate continental climate, which is tempered by Mediterranean influences in the south. The average annual temperature is 51 °F (10.5 °C), but this conceals a wide</p>
      <p>variation; temperatures as low as −37 °F (−38 °C) and as high as 113 °F (45 °C) have been recorded. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 18 inches (450 mm) in the northeast to more than</p>
      <p>47 inches (1,190 mm) in the highest mountains. The lowlands receive snowfall from mid-October to mid-May, with an annual average of 25–30 days of snow cover. Hailstorms occur between May and August.</p>
    <h2>Tourism</h2>

      <img src="Images/Bg6.jpg" alt="sunnybeach" >
      <p>Tourism in Bulgaria has grown markedly since the 1960s. Roughly 750,000 annual foreign arrivals were arriving in Bulgaria in 2005. In addition to the popular Black Sea resorts, tourists visit </p>
      <p>historical centres such as Sofia, Plovdiv, and Rila Monastery and winter sports centres such as Borovets in the Rhodope Mountains. Pirin National Park, which occupies 67,700 acres (27,400 hectares)</p>
      <p>in the Pirin Mountains, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983; the World Heritage site was expanded in 2010 to cover an additional 25,000 acres (10,000 hectares).</p>
