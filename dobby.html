    <h2>About the Chihuahua</h2>
      <p>The Chihuahua is a balanced, graceful dog of terrier-like demeanor, weighing no more than 6 pounds. </p>
      <p>The rounded “apple” head is a breed hallmark. The erect ears and full, luminous eyes are acutely expressive.</p>
      <p>Coats come in many colors and patterns, and can be long or short. The varieties are identical except for coat.</p>
      <p>Chihuahuas possess loyalty, charm, and big-dog attitude. Even tiny dogs require training, and without it this </p>
      <p>clever scamp will rule your household like a little Napoleon. Compact and confident, Chihuahuas are ideal city pets. </p>
      <p>They are too small for roughhousing with kids, and special care must be taken in cold weather, but Chihuahuas are </p>
      <p>adaptable—as long as they get lots of quality time in their preferred lap.</p>
    <h2>Nutrition</h2>
      <p>A high-quality dog food appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior) will have all the nutrients the </p>
      <p>breed needs. Some Chihuahuas are prone to getting overweight, so watch your dog’s calorie consumption and weight</p>
      <p>level. Treats can be an important aid in training, but giving too many can cause obesity. Give table scraps sparingly,</p>
      <p> if at all, especially avoiding cooked bones and foods with high fat content. Learn about which human foods are safe for </p>
      <p>dogs, and which are not. Check with your vet if you have any concerns about your dog’s weight or diet.</p>
    <h2>Grooming</h2>
      <p>The two coat varieties of the Chihuahua have slightly different grooming needs. The smooth-coat Chihuahua will need </p>
      <p>only occasional brushing and regular baths to look dapper, while the longhaired variety should have his coat brushed </p>
      <p>at least once a week to avoid any tangles or mats. Both varieties should have their nails trimmed regularly. Good dental </p>
      <p>care is necessary and should include brushing your dog’s teeth, and the vet might also recommend treats designed as part </p>
      <p>of a tooth-care program. Check the Chihuahua’s ears regularly, and remove any excess wax or debris to avoid ear infections.</p>
    <h2>Exercise</h2>
      <p>The Chihuahua loves to run and play and can usually get enough exercise in a very small space. Simply trotting around</p>
      <p>following their people is usually enough exercise for this happy breed. Short, slow walks will keep your dog in good </p>
      <p>weight and condition. Avoid overexerting the Chihuahua. If your dog is panting and working hard to keep up, it’s time</p>
      <p> to pick him up and carry him home.</p>
    <h2>Training</h2>
      <p>The Chihuahua is a very alert little dog of high intelligence. He is eager to please his humans and responds well to </p>
      <p>positive training practices. Chihuahuas seem well aware of how cute they are and learn how to get their way. From the</p>
      <p> very beginning you must enforce the fact that you are in charge. Never allow your Chihuahua puppy to do anything that</p>
      <p> will be unacceptable in an adult. They can have a bit of a “terrier” temperament, so a firm but gentle hand is necessary</p>
      <p> when training. They can excel in obedience training and other canine sports.</p>		
     <h2>Health</h2>
      <p>The majority of Chihuahuas are healthy little dogs, but there are some genetic issues that can affect the breed. You should</p>
      <p> choose your dog from a breeder who routinely does genetic health screenings on all breeding stock to ensure that the puppies </p>
      <p>they produce are as genetically sound as possible. Some of the issues that can possibly affect the Chihuahua include potential </p>
      <p>heart problems (patent ductus arteriosus, mitral valve disease), eye disease, and patellar luxation (loose kneecaps). </p>
      <p>Idiopathic epilepsy is also known to occur in the breed.</p>
